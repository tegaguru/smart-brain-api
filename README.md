# what's this about

I basically built an API for a front end project([image recogntion project](https://github.com/tegaguru/smart-brain-app)), that helps with routing and authentication. 

## Technologies used

Express

Bcrypt - This helped in hashing and making the passwords a whole lot more secure

Clarifai - This is an AI powered API that helps with everything detection. My use case in this app was for Face Detection

KNEXJS - For connecting to my Database(postgres)



### Note: you'd need to get your api key from [here](https://www.clarifai.com/) to run this, thanks!
